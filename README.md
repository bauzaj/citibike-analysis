**Citibike Analysis with Tableau**

This project explores the Citibike dataset, which contains trip data for the Citibike bike-sharing program in New York City. The project aims to gain insights into the usage patterns and behaviors of Citibike riders, as well as explore correlations between variables such as age, gender, and trip duration.

**Data Sources**

The project began by downloading the Citibike CSV files from the official Citibike website. The downloaded files were then imported into pandas for data cleaning and preparation, including removing null values and converting data types where necessary.

**Data Preparation**

After the initial cleaning, the cleaned files were exported and then imported into Tableau for further analysis. In Tableau, the files were joined together to create a comprehensive dataset that could be used to create various visualizations.

**Visualizations**

Using Tableau, a variety of visualizations were created to explore the Citibike data. Some of the key visualizations include:

  -A map of Citibike stations in New York City, color-coded by the average number of daily trips originating and ending from each station.

  -A combination of charts showing the relationship of trip duration, using different variables such as age, generation, gender.

  -A bar chart showing the most used Citibikes

  -A bar chart comparison of Subscribers and Customer growth from 2016 to 2018

**Analysis**

 - There was a 23% growth in subscribers and an 88% growth in customers.
 - The average trip duration rose by 6%.
 - Older participants tend to use the Citibike for longer trip durations, while there seems to be base line for working age participants.
 - With subscribers being the main volume driver, more users favor the citibike for their short commutes. 

**Conclusion**

This project provides valuable insights into the usage patterns and behaviors of Citibike riders. The visualizations created in Tableau help to highlight key trends and correlations in the data, which can be used to inform decisions about the future of the Citibike program.
